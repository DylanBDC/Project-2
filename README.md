# Project-2

Description:

The server file was designed to display any RPI data that connects to the server using the client for up to 50 iterations. After the 50 iterations the server will wait for a new connection until it is shut down.
The client of this program was designed to display the connection status to the server and collect the data to be sent to the server for display. 

How to use:
First, run the server and then run the client. The client should connect to the server fast and start sending data displayed in the GUI (ensure the right Address and port are used)
